				<p class="post-details">I am Louisa, a software developer from this version of the universe. I have a passion for computers and tech and see them as the chance to bring one's ideas to life - sort of decode one's ideas.<br><br><br>In 2017, I decided to leap and officially pursue my passion whilst still working at my full time job! It was the beginning of an exciting journey and I have never looked back. <br><br><br> In the time that has passed since I wrote my first program I have enjoyed the excitement that accompanies solving a problem and exploration for the sake of exploration, the rollercoaster of learning and unlearning, and the highlights of interacting with an amazing global dev community. I could go on and on about all the stuff that has become possible ever since I stepped into the framework behind computers but im hoping to keep this as short as possible.<br><br><br>With all that going on and after a great deal of self reflection, I decided to start Decode Space as an outlet for my dev journey. I like to think of it as a space to teach and learn, explore creative, random-crazy and not-so-crazy thoughts, and everything in between. <br><br><br>Decode Space is about transforming thoughts into reality.
